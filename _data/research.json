        "summary": "Abstract: Age-adjusted mortality rates are higher in “red” states, i.e., states with high support for the
  Republican Party. We ask whether this is due to state-level policies or simply due to confounding
  variables such as culture. We implement three research designs: a border county design, a regression
  discontinuity design, and a novel design exploiting the partisanship of distant parts of a state. Our
  point estimates suggest that Democratic state government slightly decreases mortality, but most
  estimates are insignificant, and in all designs we find that the correlation between partisanship and
  mortality is predominantly driven by confounding."

        "website": "http://jijee48.github.io/files/From_Prohibition_to_Choice.pdf",
        "summary": "This paper examines the effects of Nepal’s 2002 abortion law reform: the removal of one of the world’s most restrictive abortion bans on fertility and child investments. Using variation in exposure to the reform and family-level incentives to use abortion, we show that the gender gap in sibling size between firstborn-girl and firstborn-boy families declined by 65–75% post-legalization. We also find that breastfeeding duration, previously longer for boys in firstborn-girl families, became more equal, with the gap narrowing by 85%. The reform had no significant effects on vaccinations or institutional births and only weak effects on mortality. These findings highlight how access to abortion shapes fertility behavior and narrows postnatal gender gaps in settings with strong son preference."

        "name": "Gender Gap in Child Poverty: Evidence from India",
        "summary": "Abstract: Identifying the share of household resources allocated to children is challenging because consumption data are typically measured at the household level, making it difficult to distinguish individual consumption, especially for shared goods. To address this, we leverage data on private assignable goods available for each child, enabling us to analyze boys and girls as distinct entities and estimate individual-level poverty rates. Using data from India, we examine how resource allocation differs between boys and girls across families with varying poverty levels. Our findings reveal that standard poverty indices underestimate the true extent of poverty among girls."
