      "summary": "Abstract: Age-adjusted mortality rates are higher in “red” states, i.e., states with high support for the Republican Party. We ask whether this is due to state-level policies or simply due to confounding variables such as culture. We implement three research designs: a border county design, a regression discontinuity design, and a novel design exploiting the partisanship of distant parts of a state. Our point estimates suggest that Democratic state government slightly decreases mortality, but most estimates are insignificant, and in all designs we find that the correlation between partisanship and mortality is predominantly driven by confounding."

      "website": "https://jijee48.github.io/files/From_Prohibition_to_Choice.pdf",
      "summary": "Abstract: This paper examines the effects of Nepal’s abortion law reform: the removal of one of the world’s most restrictive abortion bans on fertility and child investments. Using variation in exposure to the reform and family-level incentives to use abortion, we show that the gender gap in sibling size between firstborn-girl and firstborn-boy families declined by 65–75% post-legalization. We also find that breastfeeding duration, previously longer for boys in firstborn-girl families, became more equal, with the gap narrowing by 85%. The reform had no significant effects on vaccinations or mortality. These findings highlight how access to abortion shapes fertility behavior and narrows postnatal gender gaps in settings with strong son preference.",
