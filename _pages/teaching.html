  <p>
    I view teaching as an opportunity to equip students with analytical tools to understand real-world inequalities. My courses emphasize active learning, applied data work, and connecting theory to lived experiencesâ€”from local poverty in New York to development challenges in South Asia. I strive to create an inclusive environment where all students can see themselves in economics.
