I am a fifth-year PhD student on the 2025-26 job market.

I am mainly interested in the fields of gender economics, development economics, and labor economics.
My current research focuses on how reproductive policies and intrahousehold gender preferences shape fertility and early-life investments in developing countries.
I have a strong passion for teaching. My teaching interests and qualifications include microeconomic theory, development economics, and statistical methods.
