I am mainly interested in the fields of gender economics, development economics, and applied econometrics.
My current research focuses on how reproductive policies and intrahousehold gender preferences shape fertility, breastfeeding, and early-life investments in developing countries.
I have a strong passion for teaching. My teaching interests and qualifications include microeconomic theory, development economics, and statistical methods.
