title: "Is the red-blue gap in mortality due to government?"

abstract: 'In the US, age-adjusted mortality rates are higher in ``red" states, i.e., states with high support for the Republican Party. We ask whether this is attributable to state-level policies as opposed to confounding variables such as culture. Using a variety of empirical approaches, we find that state government explains between 0 and 20\% of the mortality gap. Scaling this by the size of the (large) gap, red state policies increase mortality risk by 0-3\% relative to blue state policies.'

Age-adjusted mortality rates are higher in red states, i.e., states with high support for the Republican Party. We ask whether this is due to state-level policies or simply due to confounding variables such as culture. We implement three research designs a border county design, a regression discontinuity design, and a novel design exploiting the partisanship of distant parts of a state. Our point estimates suggest that Democratic state government slightly decreases mortality, but most estimates are insignificant, and in all designs we find that the correlation between partisanship and mortality is predominantly driven by confounding.
