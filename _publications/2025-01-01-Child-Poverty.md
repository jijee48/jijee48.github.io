abstract: "Identifying the share of household resources allocated to children is challenging because consumption data are typically measured at the household level, making it difficult to distinguish individual consumption, especially for shared goods. To address this, we leverage data on private assignable goods available for each child, enabling us to analyze boys and girls as distinct entities and estimate individual-level poverty rates. Using data from India, we examine how resource allocation differs between boys and girls across families with varying poverty levels. Our findings reveal that standard poverty indices underestimate the true extent of poverty among girls."

We use a collective household model to structurally estimate individual-level consumption for girl and boy children, separately, using household-level data. These estimates allow us to account for the unequal division of resources within the household and to measure poverty rates for girls and boys at the individual level, unlike standard poverty measures, which are measured at the household level. Our results indicate that girls are more likely to live in poverty compared to boys in India, and a significant fraction of poor girls in fact live in households that standard poverty measures would classify as non-poor.
