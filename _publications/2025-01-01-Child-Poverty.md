abstract: "Identifying the share of household resources allocated to children is challenging because consumption data are typically measured at the household level, making it difficult to distinguish individual consumption, especially for shared goods. To address this, we leverage data on private assignable goods available for each child, enabling us to analyze boys and girls as distinct entities and estimate individual-level poverty rates. Using data from India, we examine how resource allocation differs between boys and girls across families with varying poverty levels. Our findings reveal that standard poverty indices underestimate the true extent of poverty among girls."
