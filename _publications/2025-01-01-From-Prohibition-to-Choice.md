abstract: "We examine the impact of the 2002 abortion legalization reform in Nepal on fertility decisions and child investments. Nepal's abortion laws pre-2002 were one of the world's most stringent, criminalizing pregnancy terminations and prosecuting and imprisoning women and their family members. We exploit the quasi-random variation in the sex of the firstborn child to estimate how the reform shaped family size, breastfeeding, vaccination, and child survival. Legalization substantially reduced son-biased fertility stopping, narrowing sibship-size disparities between firstborn-girl and firstborn-boy families by nearly three-quarters. It also closed much of the pre-existing gender gap in breastfeeding duration, consistent with reduced reliance on breastfeeding as a fertility-spacing tool. By contrast, effects on vaccinations and survival were limited, reflecting that these inputs were less closely tied to fertility behavior. These findings show that abortion access relaxed fertility constraints and altered investments linked to fertility timing, while broader forms of gender inequality persisted. The results extend the literature on the quantity–quality trade-off by showing how reproductive autonomy interacts with cultural preferences to shape fertility and child well-being."

We examine the impact of the 2002 abortion legalization reform in Nepal on fertility decisions and child investments. Nepal's abortion laws pre-2002 were one of the world's most stringent, criminalizing pregnancy terminations and prosecuting and imprisoning women and their family members. We exploit the quasi-random variation in the sex of the firstborn child to estimate how the reform shaped family size, breastfeeding, vaccination, and child survival. Legalization substantially reduced son-biased fertility stopping, narrowing sibship-size disparities between firstborn-girl and firstborn-boy families by nearly three-quarters. It also closed much of the pre-existing gender gap in breastfeeding duration, consistent with reduced reliance on breastfeeding as a fertility-spacing tool. By contrast, effects on vaccinations and survival were limited, reflecting that these inputs were less closely tied to fertility behavior. These findings show that abortion access relaxed fertility constraints and altered investments linked to fertility timing, while broader forms of gender inequality persisted. The results extend the literature on the quantity–quality trade-off by showing how reproductive autonomy interacts with cultural preferences to shape fertility and child well-being.
