abstract: 'This paper examines the effects of Nepal’s 2002 abortion law reform: the removal of one of the world’s most restrictive abortion bans on fertility and child investments. Using variation in exposure to the reform and family-level incentives to use abortion, we show that the gender gap in sibling size between firstborn-girl and firstborn-boy families declined by 65–75% post-legalization. We also find that breastfeeding duration, previously longer for boys in firstborn-girl families, became more equal, with the gap narrowing by 85%. The reform had no significant effects on vaccinations or institutional births and only weak effects on mortality. These findings highlight how access to abortion shapes fertility behavior and narrows postnatal gender gaps in settings with strong son preference.'

This paper examines the effects of Nepal’s 2002 abortion law reform: the removal of one of the world’s most restrictive abortion bans on fertility and child investments. Using variation in exposure to the reform and family-level incentives to use abortion, we show that the gender gap in sibling size between firstborn-girl and firstborn-boy families declined by 65–75\% post-legalization. We also find that breastfeeding duration, previously longer for boys in firstborn-girl families, became more equal, with the gap narrowing by 85\%. The reform had no significant effects on vaccinations or institutional births and only weak effects on mortality. These findings highlight how access to abortion shapes fertility behavior and narrows postnatal gender gaps in settings with strong son preference.
