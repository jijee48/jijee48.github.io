abstract: "We study whether expanding reproductive autonomy changes fertility and early-life investments in a son-preferring society, in the context of Nepal’s 2002 abortion legalization. Using a triple-difference-in-differences design comparing girls and boys across firstborn-sex families before and after the reform, we find that the abortion legalization substantially reduced son-biased fertility stopping: the sibship-size gap between firstborn-girl and firstborn-boy families fell by nearly three-quarters. In terms of investments, daughters in firstborn-girl families gained about two months of breastfeeding, closing most of the pre-existing deficit, also consistent with reduced reliance on breastfeeding as a birth spacing tool. Effects on vaccination and under-five survival were limited, aligning with these inputs being less tied to fertility timing. Abortion access, therefore, relaxed fertility constraints and shifted investments on the birth spacing sensitive margin."

We examine the impact of the 2002 abortion legalization reform in Nepal on fertility decisions and child investments. Nepal's abortion laws pre-2002 were one of the world's most stringent, criminalizing pregnancy terminations and prosecuting and imprisoning women and their family members. We exploit the quasi-random variation in the sex of the firstborn child to estimate how the reform shaped family size, breastfeeding, vaccination, and child survival. Legalization substantially reduced son-biased fertility stopping, narrowing sibship-size disparities between firstborn-girl and firstborn-boy families by nearly three-quarters. It also closed much of the pre-existing gender gap in breastfeeding duration, consistent with reduced reliance on breastfeeding as a fertility-spacing tool. By contrast, effects on vaccinations and survival were limited, reflecting that these inputs were less closely tied to fertility behavior. These findings show that abortion access relaxed fertility constraints and altered investments linked to fertility timing, while broader forms of gender inequality persisted. The results extend the literature on the quantity–quality trade-off by showing how reproductive autonomy interacts with cultural preferences to shape fertility and child well-being.
