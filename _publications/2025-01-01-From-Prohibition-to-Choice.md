title: "From Prohibition to Choice: The Impact of Abortion Legalization on Fertility and Child Investments in Nepal"
collection: publications

abstract: "We study whether expanding reproductive autonomy changes fertility and early-life investments in a son-preferring society, in the context of Nepal’s 2002 abortion legalization. Using a triple-difference-in-differences design comparing girls and boys across firstborn-sex families before and after the reform, we find that the abortion legalization substantially reduced son-biased fertility stopping: the sibship-size gap between firstborn-girl and firstborn-boy families fell by nearly three-quarters. In terms of investments, daughters in firstborn-girl families gained about two months of breastfeeding, closing most of the pre-existing deficit, also consistent with reduced reliance on breastfeeding as a birth spacing tool. Effects on vaccination and under-five survival were limited, aligning with these inputs being less tied to fertility timing. Abortion access, therefore, relaxed fertility constraints and shifted investments on the birth spacing sensitive margin."

We study whether expanding reproductive autonomy changes fertility and early-life investments in a son-preferring society, in the context of Nepal’s 2002 abortion legalization.
