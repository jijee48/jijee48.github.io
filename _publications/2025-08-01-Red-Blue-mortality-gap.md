title: "Is the red-blue gap in mortality due to government?"

abstract: 'In the US, age-adjusted mortality rates are higher in ``red" states, i.e., states with high support for the Republican Party. We ask whether this is attributable to state-level policies as opposed to confounding variables such as culture. Using a variety of empirical approaches, we find that state government explains between 0 and 20\% of the mortality gap. Scaling this by the size of the (large) gap, red state policies increase mortality risk by 0-3\% relative to blue state policies.'

In the US, age-adjusted mortality rates are higher in ``red" states, i.e., states with high support for the Republican Party. We ask whether this is attributable to state-level policies as opposed to confounding variables such as culture. Using a variety of empirical approaches, we find that state government explains between 0 and 20\% of the mortality gap. Scaling this by the size of the (large) gap, red state policies increase mortality risk by 0-3\% relative to blue state policies.
