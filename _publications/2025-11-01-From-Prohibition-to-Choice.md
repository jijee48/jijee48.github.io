abstract: "We study whether expanding reproductive autonomy changes fertility and early-life investments in a son-preferring society, in the context of Nepal’s 2002 abortion legalization. Using a triple-difference-in-differences design comparing girls and boys across firstborn-sex families before and after the reform, we find that the abortion legalization substantially reduced son-biased fertility stopping: the sibship-size gap between firstborn-girl and firstborn-boy families fell by nearly three-quarters. In terms of investments, daughters in firstborn-girl families gained about two months of breastfeeding, closing most of the pre-existing deficit, also consistent with reduced reliance on breastfeeding as a birth spacing tool. Effects on vaccination and under-five survival were limited, aligning with these inputs being less tied to fertility timing. Abortion access, therefore, relaxed fertility constraints and shifted investments on the birth spacing sensitive margin."

In societies with son-preference, the transition from high fertility to low fertility is often accompanied by a skewed sex ratio at birth. How expanding reproductive autonomy in such societies changes fertility and early-life investments in children remains unclear. We study this question in the context of Nepal by evaluating the impact of the 2002 abortion legalization. Using a triple-difference design comparing girls and boys across firstborn-sex families before and after the reform, we find that the abortion legalization substantially reduced son-biased fertility stopping: the gap in the number of children between firstborn-girl and firstborn-boy families fell by nearly three-fifths, while the probability that a girl is missing due to sex-selective abortion rose by 1.8 percentage points. A back-of-the-envelope calculation implies that roughly 1 in 75 girls is missing from post-reform birth cohorts. On investments, daughters in firstborn-girl families gained about two months of breastfeeding, closing most of the pre-existing deficit. Taken together, the policy response to abortion legalization in a son-preferring society indicates a quantity-quality trade-off: lower cost of achieving desired family size and sex mix can lead to intensified prenatal selection against girls and increased early-life investments in those who are born.
