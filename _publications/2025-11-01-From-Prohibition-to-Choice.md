abstract: "We study whether expanding reproductive autonomy changes fertility and early-life investments in a son-preferring society, in the context of Nepal’s 2002 abortion legalization. Using a triple-difference-in-differences design comparing girls and boys across firstborn-sex families before and after the reform, we find that the abortion legalization substantially reduced son-biased fertility stopping: the sibship-size gap between firstborn-girl and firstborn-boy families fell by nearly three-quarters. In terms of investments, daughters in firstborn-girl families gained about two months of breastfeeding, closing most of the pre-existing deficit, also consistent with reduced reliance on breastfeeding as a birth spacing tool. Effects on vaccination and under-five survival were limited, aligning with these inputs being less tied to fertility timing. Abortion access, therefore, relaxed fertility constraints and shifted investments on the birth spacing sensitive margin."

We evaluate Nepal’s 2002 abortion legalization to study how expanding reproductive autonomy changes fertility and early-life investments in a son-preferring society. Using a triple-difference design comparing girls and boys across firstborn-sex families before and after the reform, we find that the abortion legalization substantially reduced son-biased fertility stopping: the sibling size gap between firstborn-girl and firstborn-boy families fell by nearly three-fifths. On investments, daughters in firstborn-girl families gained about two months of breastfeeding, closing most of the pre-existing deficit. This pattern is consistent with two channels: parents do less early weaning to hasten the next pregnancy, and a higher share of daughters who are born are more wanted and receive more investment. We find little change in vaccinations or under-five survival. At the same time, sex-selective abortion increased. A back-of-the-envelope calculation implies roughly 1 in 75 girls is missing from post-reform birth cohorts. Overall, legal access to abortion reduced extra childbearing driven by son preference and improved spacing-linked investments for girls, while worsening gender imbalance at birth.
